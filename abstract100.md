# Dark field and transmission in the Compton regime

For higher energy X-rays produced by a 160 kVp tube, Compton scattering is
the dominant interaction with matter, especially for medical applications.
Our experiments with a 160 kVp source and a 120 keV design energy
interferometer show a relationship between the dark field and absorption
signals that is different from earlier, low energy experiments. This
relationship also affects the noise properties of the differential phase
image. We can combine all of these information to choose an optimal
design energy and geometrical parameters for a grating interferometer.
